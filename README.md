# Hi, I'm Muhammad Badraan ðŸ‘‹

## My Story

Iâ€™ve been into gaming since I was a kid â€” titles like **Minecraft**, **Fortnite**, and more. But playing them wasnâ€™t enough for me. I needed to know **how** they were made. That curiosity got me started early: at around age 10, without a clear roadmap, I dove into anything I could find. I got my hands dirty with **Minecraft modding in Java**, **Python scripting**, and even **C# game development**.

Most people stop at that stage â€” it's chaotic and overwhelming. But for me, it was fun. That curiosity kept me going.

At 15, I joined **WE School**, where I began to specialize in **Web Development and Programming**. Thatâ€™s when things got serious. I quickly found that I was good at it â€” and I enjoyed it even more. Today, web development is my main focus and what I do best.
